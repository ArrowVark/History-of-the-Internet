        <p class="boxTime">1969</p>
        <p class="boxText">ARPANET was created to connect academic and research institutions with the benefit of being able to withstand a nuclear attack. This was the start of the Internet as we know it today, as this was the first time packet-switching technology was being used. Without ARPANET, there is the chance the internet would look completly different, or even exist at all!</p>
